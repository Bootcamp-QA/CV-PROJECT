## TEST STRATEGY

1. Functional test scenarios are defined for each user story using Gherkin language using Test Management Tool Zephyr Scale for Jira.
2. Static Test is executed after each development change using SONARQUBE tool [![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=Bootcamp-QA_CV-PROJECT&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=Bootcamp-QA_CV-PROJECT)
3. Functional test scenarios are executed manually in Dektop and Mobile for each user story. Bugs found are created on JIRA and linked to the related user story and test scenario. Test results are saved using Zephyr scale.
4. Regression test scenarios are executed manually in Desktop and Mobile at the end of each Sprint for Desktop and Mobile. Test results are saved using Zephyr scale.
5. New release version is created at the end of each Sprint, including:
- User stories completed.
- Functional test results and bug reports.
- Regression test results.
